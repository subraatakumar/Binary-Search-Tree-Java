# Binary-Search-Tree-Java
Different binary search tree operations are tried to explain in this repository

## Traversal : visiting each element of a tree.

Four types of traversal are :
- Preorder Traversal : process root node, then its left/right subtrees
- Inorder Traversal : process left subtree, then root node, then right
- Postorder Traversal : process left/right subtrees, then root node
- Level Order Traversal : Process level wise
